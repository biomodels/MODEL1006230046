# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Cells behaving badly: a theoretical model for the Fas/FasL system in tumour immunology.**   
Webb SD, Sherratt JA, Fish RG. _Math Biosci_ 2002 Sep-Oct;179(2):113-29

**Abstract:**   
One proposed mechanism of tumour escape from immune surveillance is tumour up-
regulation of the cell surface ligand FasL, which can lead to apoptosis of Fas
receptor (Fas) positive lymphocytes. Based upon this 'counterattack', we have
developed a mathematical model involving tumour cell-lymphocyte interaction,
cell surface expression of Fas/FasL, and their secreted soluble forms. The
model predicts that (a) the production of soluble forms of Fas and FasL will
lead to the down-regulation of the immune response; (b) matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP) inactivation should lead to increased membrane FasL
and result in a higher rate of Fas-mediated apoptosis for lymphocytes than for
tumour cells. Recent studies on cancer patients lend support for these
predictions. The clinical implications are two-fold. Firstly, the use of broad
spectrum MMP inhibitors as anti-angiogenic agents may be compromised by their
adverse effect on tumour FasL up-regulation. Also, Fas/FasL interactions may
have an impact on the outcome of numerous ongoing immunotherapeutic trials
since the final common pathway of all these approaches is the transduction of
death signals within the tumour cell.
